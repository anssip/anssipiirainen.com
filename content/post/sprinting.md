# To sprint or not to sprint?

{{% post-meta %}}

Here is a lesson I learned recently: Scrum sprints are excellent if you want to squeeze the maximum performance from your team. Scrum also helps to gain sharp focus on the most important things that you should finish first.

## Kanban vs Scrum

Our team started with a Kanban process. We had a backlog of tasks, and we started working with daily standup meetings and biweekly retrospectives. In the beginning, things were looking good, and we started finishing work slowly but surely. Then things began to get downhill.

There was a recent major release of the system we were assigned to work on. The release was made before our new team inherited the project and the codebase. The release was a bit disastrous, and our backlog soon started to get bigger and bigger with bugs. New issues kept piling up, and our focus shifted from one critical problem to another, hurting our ability to concentrate and complete the fixes. Our team decided to opt-in to a micromanagement approach for solving these problems. The boss assigned every task to individual developers t A lot of focus was put into prioritizing the tasks. 

The best idea I can think of for a situation like this is to use **Good Old Scrum Sprints**. 

* Do some sprint planning: Prioritize the issues, and take the most important ones to your first sprint backlog.
* Make sure that the team commits to completing the tasks in the sprint backlog.
* The Sprint could be one week long, or perhaps two weeks.
* Release at the end of each sprint.
* The team can self-organize and decide how to accomplish the sprint goal. No need for micromanagement here.

This has the following benefits:

* You will have a focused Sprint backlog where you can clearly see what you want to finish
* Your team can concentrate on the sprint and ignore everything else that is not in the sprint scope
* The most critical issues are time-boxed into the sprint: clears the focus on the most critical issues
* The next sprint then concentrates on the next set of prioritized tasks

## Final thoughts

I'm now thinking that Scrum works better for a new team. It is also a better choice when you have time pressure to finish things quickly.

However, I think pushing your team to maximum performance cannot be sustained in the long run: people burn out, and you risk losing people. Kanban works excellent if you have a stable product and things are going smoothly.
