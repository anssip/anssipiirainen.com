 My blog - a Hugo website.

## Development

Start the nix shell:

```bash
nix-shell
```

After this you have `hugo` in your path and you can do things like:

1. `hugo serve` to start the development server
2. `hugo` to generate the site
2. `hugo deploy` to deploy the site

to deploy, first run `hugo`, then run `hugo deploy`.
